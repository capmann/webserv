# webserv

Description:

Webserv is a custom HTTP server written from scratch in C++. This project was conceived to demonstrate a deep understanding of web protocols, socket programming, and server management. By simulating the behavior of real-world web servers, Webserv allows for an exploration into the intricacies of network programming and client-server interaction.

Features:

    Full HTTP 1.1 compliance for robust web communication
    Asynchronous request processing for efficient resource management
    Support for GET, POST, and DELETE methods to handle various client requests
    Customizable server configuration through a well-structured settings file
    Integration of a scalable I/O multiplexing mechanism
    Dynamic content generation through CGI scripts
    Secure handling of concurrent connections
    MIME type recognition and appropriate response formatting

Challenges:

    Mastery of socket-level communication and HTTP protocol specifications
    Implementing a multi-threaded server capable of handling multiple simultaneous connections without deadlock or race conditions
    Crafting a parser to interpret and respond to a wide array of HTTP requests

Learning Outcomes:

    Developed a comprehensive understanding of network protocols and server architecture
    Honed advanced C++ programming skills, with an emphasis on network and concurrency programming
    Acquired practical experience in system design and the creation of scalable, high-performance software
